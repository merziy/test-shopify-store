# Custom Shopify Theme

This is a Shopify theme I developed based on the Shopify theme [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn). I picked Dawn because of it's semantic HTML/Liquid focused approach that minimizes JavaScript for a very fast and minimal website. 

## Features

This website has five pages:

1. Home
2. Shop
3. About Us
4. Blog
5. Contact

### Home

The store is a fictional business that refurbishes mid-century chairs. 
I redesigned a lot of the home page to reflect what I imagine a new business to e-commerce would want to display. The page has a hero image, along with a product selection and text informing about a return policy.

### Shop

The shopping page lists all of the products and a few of the products are in a collection. There is a functional shopping cart that has several filers. There is a search bar in the header for the entire site.

### About Us

Since I have implicated this business is a new company, I created an About Us so the client could provide some copy on what they would want any potential customers knowing about them. The About Us page has a pretty image and some text under it.

### Blog

The Blog page was what took the most hand coding, because I did not like the way the default templates style the blog and especially the articles. I changed the code for a more 'minimal' experiencing when reading the articles. 

### Contact Us

There is a standard contact form in the case a potential customer has any questions or requests for the company.
